# Inventory Tracker

Hi! This was made for the Shopify Backend Challenge. The link to the instructions are here [Fall 2022 - Shopify Developer Intern Challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PoxpoaJymXmFB3iCMhGL6js-ibht7GO_DkCF2elCySU/edit)

Here is a link to the same repo, in a Replit. Just press the 'Run' Button. [Replit](https://replit.com/@SavarJ/inventory-tracker#.replit)

Here is a link to the same project, hosted on Heroku. No need to do anything! [Heroku](https://savarj-inventory-tracker.herokuapp.com/)

The technologies I used are:
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB
* EJS
* Bootstrap

To try locally, just clone the repo, cd into it. Then run ```npm install``` and update the ```.env.example``` file. Run ```npm start``` and you should be good to go!
